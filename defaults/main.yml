# Role default lower priority variables

# List of dicts with groups to configure. The dicts have the same attributes
# that the ones expected by the ansible group module. For example:
#
# groups:
#   - name: somegroup
#     gid: 2500

# Dicitionary with the defaults options to use if no other ones are specified in
# the `groups_list` variable. The members of the dict are the same attributes
# that the ones expected by the ansible group module

# Indicate `groups_list` must be loaded also from host variables. Any host
# variable that begins with "groups_*" and contains the necessary attributes
# will be loaded as an item to manage by the role. The variables must follow the
# structure detailed before for `groups_list`

groups_load_from_hostvars: no

# Indicate what to do with orphan users result of a group deletion. Can be:
#
# - `move`: move orphan users to the group specified in the variable
#   `groups_orphan_users_group`
# - `remove`: delete orphan users
# - `error`: raise error if the deletion of a group could lead to orphan users.

groups_orphan_users_action: error

# Group to move in orphan users if the variable `groups_orphan_users_action` is
# set to `move`

# Indicate if orphan user removal must be forced if `groups_orphan_users_action`
# is set to `remove`
